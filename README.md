You use a slingshot to shoot with apples. Be first to destroy the whole enemy base, but be aware, the other side shoots back. This game has a balanced mix of puzzle, strategy, patience and action.

This is for one or two players! You can play this against anyone who sits next to you - or against yourself. You can also play against a computer controlled opponent. More features, more fun and more levels will come soon.
