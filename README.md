Features:

*    high resolution quality graphics
*    realistic physics
*    lag-free and smooth gameplay
*    fine detailed animations and particle systems
*    brand new and innovative game concept
*    single/multiplayer

You use a slingshot to shoot with apples. Be first to destroy the whole enemy base, but be aware, the other side shoots back. This game has a balanced mix of puzzle, strategy, patience and action.

This is for one or two players! You can play this against anyone who sits next to you - or against yourself. You can also play against a computer controlled opponent. More features, more fun and more levels will come soon.

## Rules

### How to win a round ?

Drag the apple and shoot it towards the funny little enemies on the other side. **The player who destroys all enemies on the other side first, is the winner.**

Since player 1 has always the first shot, player 2 will always be allowed to perform the last shot. Same chances for both.

If both players destroy all enemies in the same round, the player with most points wins.

You can win the round, even if you have less points, by destroying all targets with less shots.

### What about the points ?

The points decide, who is the winner, when both players finish the game equally quick.

The points also accumulate, when you play many rounds in a row. So you can try to achieve new high-scores by playing 18 rounds in a row. 

If you play 18 rounds against another human you can decide if "most won rounds" or "most overall points" is the overall winner.

You get points by hitting targets and wood blocks. Each target has 1000 HP, so when you destroy it (with 1 or many shots) you will get up to 1000 HP. Hiting the targets on your own side grants 0 points. The wood blocks give less points, but it might still be a good strategy to destroy as much wood as possible on your way to the victory.

Additionally there are some unlockable achievements for gaining many points.
